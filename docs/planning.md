# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
 In Bristol and South Gloucestershire, people who likes to cycling,They don't have an easy way to find information about cycling routes for leisure rides, especially routes with different distances and difficulty levels. There's no system to shows all the important details about route length, difficulty, or nearby areas, which makes it difficult for cyclists to find the good routes for them. And goal of this project is to make a simple web app to helps users easily find information and explore different cycling routes for leisure, organized by distance and difficulty, in and around Bristol and South Gloucestershire.
 
### Business benefits
