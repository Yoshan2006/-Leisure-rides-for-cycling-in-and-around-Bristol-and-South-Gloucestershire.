                    <h3>How can I look at a route?</h3>
                    <p>By clicking on a route on the main page, it will highlight the route, as well as show the start and end points.</p>

                    <h3>How does route generation work?</h3>
                    <p>Our route generator creates routes along existing cycle routes - it finds the quickest way through existing routes to where you would like to go!</p>

                    <h3>Can I use this as a GPS tracker while I travel along a route?</h3>
                    <p>Not at the moment. This is purely for discovering the existing leisure cycle routes and creating routes through them. We may think to implement this in the future.</p>
